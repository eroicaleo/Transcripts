2 Broke Girls – Season 01 Episode 01 Pilot
=============================

Scene: In the restaurant.
-------------------------

Oleg: Pick up! Tables 12, 4, 11.

Max: Got it. Hey, when you get a second, stop looking at my boobs.

Customer 1: Excuse me. Waitress? Dude?

Max: Hi, what can I get ya?

Customer 1: We need some...

Max: Is that annoying? Is that obnoxious and rude? Would you find it distracting if someone did that to you while you were working? Oh, you don't have a job. Sorry.

Customer 2: Damn, dude, she burned you.

Max: No, hipster. Do not think we're on the same team. We have nothing in common. I wear knit hats when it's cold out. You wear knit hats cause of Coldplay. You have tattoos to piss off your dad. My dad doesn't know he's my dad. And finally, you think... this is the sound that gets you service. I think... This is the sound that dries up my vagina.

Customer 1: The other waitress disappeared, the Russian one. We need horseradish.

Customer 2: Please.

Max: That, ladies, is how you treat a waitress. 

Scene: In the kitchen of the restaurant.
----------------------------------------

Max: Paulina!

Paulina: Oh, so... so good, oh...

Max: Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you were on break. I just need some horseradish.

Paulina: Here. Oh, cool.

Scene: Back to the restaurant.
------------------------------

Customer 3: Excuse me, where's my waitress?

Max: She's coming.

Scene: Next day in the restaurant.
----------------------------------

Max: Earl. Earl! I made your favorite, red velvet.

Earl: My little cupcake brought me a cupcake. Let me pay you for that.

Max: Oh, no, no. It's on the house. It's your birthday. How old are you gonna be?

Earl: 75.

Max: Oh, Earl, if you were just three years younger.

Earl: Max, Max, big news. The new boss fired that Russian waitress, Paulina. Turns out chesty Kournikova was Vladimir Puttin' it out.

Han Lee: Hello today. I have paycheck for you.

Max: I need to talk to you. You fired Paulina, Han?

Han Lee: I am no longer Han Lee. I have new American name to go with changing neighborhood.

Max: To go with “the” changing neighborhood. You need to remember this for your immigration exam.

Han Lee: Correct. To go with “the” changing neighborhood.

Max: Bryce? Your name is Bryce Lee? Wait, wait, um, um, um... Don't hire a new waitress, okay? I've been doing all the work anyway, and I really could use the extra money.

Han Lee: You need help.

Max: No, I don't.

Han Lee: Everyone need help sometimes.

Max: I don't. I've been waiting my whole life, okay? I've waited on tables, I've waited in bars, I've waited on home pregnancy tests.

Han Lee: I already hire new waitress. She work in all top restaurants in Manhattan. I gave her Paulina's uniform.

Caroline Channing: Hi. Mr. Lee, not to complain, but I think someone wore this uniform before me, like right before me. Is it possible that I could get another one? Maybe one that's a little less moist. Also this mustard color doesn't really go with my skin tone, neither do the mustard stains... And these various other stains, and smells. I hope that's clam chowder. So... I think it'd be better for everyone, including my immune system, if I just keep on wearing what I'm wearing, and not the apron, 'cause this is Chanel. So thank you, and let's waitress.

Max: Whatever that is, it does not belong in this diner. It belongs in a show on Bravo.

Scene: In the kitchen of the restaurant.
----------------------------------------

Han Lee: But she blonde, hair so shiny, good for business.

Max: Where do you even find these people? The Russian hooker, the one before that was a meth addict.

Han Lee: You train her, I am boss. Da boss.

Max: Fine, but make her wear the uniform. Are you sure we can't get the meth addict back? She was really good at cleaning.

Han Lee: But her teeth fall out.

Max: You are really judgmental, you know that?

Scene: In the kitchen of the restaurant.
----------------------------------------

Max: I'm only gonna say this once, so pay attention.

Caroline Channing: I'm Caroline, by the way. And you're Max?

Max: Don't get attached. This is the Williamsburg diner, owned by Han Lee, Who just changed his name to Bryce Lee, because I guess he wants people to take him even less seriously. Eight months ago he bought it from the Russian mob. Clientele used to be all eastern bloc criminals and crack whores, but then he took it over and ruined it.

Oleg: Hey, sexy woman. You look so pretty today. You look so beautiful, I forgot how bad your personality is.

Max: Thanks, Oleg.

Oleg: Hey, Barbie.

Max: That's Oleg. He will hit on you aggressively and relentlessly. He doesn't realize he looks like that, and I don't have the heart to tell him.

Customer 4: Miss, could we have some menus?

Caroline Channing: Oh, sure.

Max: Don't smile. Cause it raises the bar, and then I have to smile, and I can't be doing that. It's exhausting and I have a bad back. That's Earl, we're in love. Do not talk to him, unless you want to feel whiter than you already are. Oh, and that stain? Not clam chowder. Go marry the ketchups.

Caroline Channing: Marry the ketchups. I'm on it.

Max: Okay. Now divorce the ketchups. Stop! Stop! Stop! There's no such thing as divorcing the ketchups. You've never waitressed a day in your life.

Caroline Channing: Yes, I have.

Max: You expect me to believe you after watching that whole Temple Grandin routine? I'm telling Lee.

Caroline Channing: Okay, okay, I may have enhanced my resume.

Max: Enhanced? What, are we in Paris?

Caroline Channing: Please, I really need this job, okay? We lost all of our money. My trust fund was taken for legal fees. My dad is in jail.

Max: What? What are you, Martin Channing's daughter? Where's the paper? Martin Channing? The guy who ripped off the entire city is your father.

Caroline Channing: He told us we were having a good year.

Max: You're Caroline Channing. You're like a billionaire.

Caroline Channing: Was. Was a billionaire. They froze all our assets, everything's gone. I only have what I could grab, and I grabbed all the wrong things.

Max: So do you know the president?

Caroline Channing: I've met him.

Max: He's hot.

Caroline Channing: He's the president.

Max: Have you been to Switzerland?

Caroline Channing: Yes.

Max: Do you have a horse?

Caroline Channing: Yes.

Max: Do you know Paris Hilton?

Caroline Channing: No, she's a hundred.

Customer 5: Excuse me, uh, two hot chocolate, please.

Max: Comin' up.

Caroline Channing: Let me do that, please. I'm a really fast learner. I went to Wharton business school. I got 2,300 on my SAT.

Max: Can you make a hot chocolate, or not? Nailed it.

Scene: On the couch of the restaurant.
--------------------------------------

Max: We split the tips. Give me yours. You did better than I thought you would.

Caroline Channing: Listen, tonight I thought of a way we could make some extra money. They've totally underestimated the price point on those red velvet cupcakes. In Manhattan the asking price is at least seven, so we could sell them for seven, and then pocket the difference.

Max: Nothing about that sounds wrong to you?

Caroline Channing: It's not our fault that the idiot who makes the cupcakes doesn't know their worth.

Max: I'm the idiot who makes the cupcakes.

Caroline Channing: New information.

Max: That's stupid. No one would pay $7 for one of my cupcakes.

Caroline Channing: Really? 'Cause...

Max: Well, at least we know you're not adopted.

Scene: Outside of the restaurant.
---------------------------------

Max: So how'd you even end up in Brooklyn?

Caroline Channing: Oh, I went on monster.com. Typed in "place where nobody from the Upper East Side would ever go, ever," and this diner came up.

Max: You can't wear a fancy leather jacket outside in this neighborhood. You have to turn it inside out.

Max: Fur. Cool. Turn it back. So where do you live?

Caroline Channing: Our townhouse was taken and bolted up by the bank, so...

Max: Is this where I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?

Caroline Channing: I mean, I don't want you to, but just so you know, a well-adjusted person would.

Max: I'm dead inside.

Caroline Channing: You make that pretty obvious. Anyway, I'm just gonna stay in the city with a friend.

Max: I live a couple of blocks that way. I'd walk you to the subway, it's just that I don't want to.

Caroline Channing: Got it.

Max: Okay. 

Scene: In Max’s apartment.
--------------------------

Max: Robbie! Why is the music so loud? It's 3:00 in the morning.

Robbie: I'm sorry.

Max: It's cool. So what are you doin'?

Robbie: The band's practicing.

Max: But you're not playing any instruments.

Robbie: Yeah, that's how we practice. We, like, listen to other good music, and play it in our head.

Max: It's like the Secret. Well, I have a secret for you guys. Get out!

Robbie: Uh, you guys better go.

Robbie’s friends: We should go.

Max: Sorry guys, I still have to make the cupcakes.

Robbie’s friend 1: Cupcakes? For why? You can just buy 'em at the store.

Robbie: You can do that in the morning, babe, come to bed.

Max: No, I can't. I have to be in the city by 10:00. Fine. You can have three minutes. Fine, you can have eight, one for each ab.

Scene: In the subway.
=====================

Broadcast: Stand clear of the closing doors.

Max: Well, I can cross that off my bucket list.

Caroline Channing: I have a taser! Oh, my God. I am so sorry. I didn't think it would hurt so much. It's pink.

Max: It didn't feel pink.

Caroline Channing: I didn't know it was you. I thought I was being raped.

Max: That's not what rape feels like. Did you... did you sleep on the subway?

Caroline Channing: I had nowhere else to go, and I'm too afraid to sleep outside on the street.

Max: God, you're spoiled.

Broadcast: Next stop, Greenpoint.

Max: Ugh, get your stuff, come on! I'll take you to my place, but hurry. Cause I have to be in the city in 30 minutes.

Passenger: Call me.

Scene: In Max’s apartment.
--------------------------

Caroline Channing: Oh, my god, you've been robbed!

Max: This is how it always looks.

Caroline Channing: Oh, my God, totally cute!

Max: All right, I'll be back at 4:00, and we can go to work together. Bathroom, bedroom, boyfriend sleeps till 4:00, yard.

Caroline Channing: Oh, you have a yard. Looks like a really nice place to relax and do crack.

Max: It is. I gotta go, I'm gonna be late for my other job in the city.

Caroline Channing: You have two jobs?

Max: Yes, I babysit for a Manhattan socialite diva. Now I have a set.

Scene: In Peach’s apartment.
----------------------------

Max: Sorry I'm late.

Peach: Oh, thank God you're here, there is a bridge and tunnel smell over by the babies that's stressing me out.

Max: Their diapers probably need to be changed.

Peach: Again? I swear, the morning nanny just did that. Motherhood is for reals. Max, remind me, what's my Twitter password?

Max:Twitter password.

Peach: Yes!

Max: Hi, Brad. Hi, Angelina.

Peach: Max, I need to tell you something because we're family. Now get me room temperature water and come over here. We are victims of the Channing Ponzi scheme. Me, David, and Brangelina.

Max: How much money did you lose?

Peach: Hold my hands. Nothing. But it really scared me. Open that?

Max: So do you know Caroline Channing?

Peach: No, but she lost everything. She has no money. Can you imagine having no money? I mean, you wouldn't even have any money.

Max: You should twit that.

Peach: And no one will even talk to her. I heard she went to six different friends' houses for a place to stay, and they all had to pretend they weren't home.

Max: That's not cool.

Peach: Yeah.

Max: That's really sad.

Peach: So sad. Breaks my heart. I guess motherhood has really opened me up emotionally. Max, I need to hold one of the babies, bring me one. No, the other one. That's not the good one.

Scene: In Max’s apartment.
--------------------------

Robbie: Hello.

Caroline Channing: Oh, hi. Oh, I'm so sorry if I woke you up.

Robbie: Who are you?

Caroline Channing: I'm Max's friend. Uh, don't tell her I said that. I have a feeling if she heard me call her my friend, she'd stab me.

Robbie: What are you doin' over there?

Caroline Channing: Just washing my uniform, trying to make it a little more cute and a little less crusty.

Robbie: Oh, watch out!

Caroline Channing: Oh! Sorry, oh, my... Do you have a towel or a rag? Or something?

Robbie: No, I... I got it.

Caroline Channing: Oh, okay.

Robbie: I'm Robbie.

Caroline Channing: I'm uncomfortable. You're getting me wet.

Robbie: That's the point.

Caroline Channing: You're Max's boyfriend.

Robbie: It's cool.

Caroline Channing: No, it's not. Back up, Jersey shore. You're pathetic, and that's coming from someone who's homeless and wearing white after a labor day. And I've seen better.

Robbie: No, you haven't.

Scene: In the restaurant.
-------------------------

Max: Hey. Why didn't you wait for me? I thought we were coming over together.

Caroline Channing: Oh. Um, I wanted to get here early to marry the ketchups.

Max: Listen, I heard something really upsetting about you today.

Caroline Channing: What did he say, that I came on to him?

Max: Him who?

Caroline Channing: Nothing.

Max: Him, Robbie?

Caroline Channing: It's none of my business, but you deserve better than that guy.

Max: Yeah, it is none of your business. Ooh, I was just starting to feel sorry for you.

Caroline Channing: I'm just saying, you're worth more than that.

Max: What, I'm supposed to believe you about this? The person who lied on their resume, and lied about the cupcakes... you're a liar.

Caroline Channing: I'm just trying to help.

Max: You know what? Since you seem to know so much about everything, why don't you take your Wharton degree, and your ridiculous coat, and figure this all out yourself.

Caroline Channing: Max. Max, wait.

Max: Oh, look, The Arcade Fire concert just let out across the street, good luck with that.

Caroline Channing: She's coming back, right? She's not gonna leave me here alone with a restaurant full of people?

Earl: Let me put it to you this way. You might as well be a night maid at the Schwarzenegger house. You got screwed.

Scene: In Max’s apartment.
--------------------------

Robbie: Oh, yeah. That feels so good. Now put your tambourine around it.

Max: Hi, honey, I'm home. I want you gone by the time I get back.

Robbie: Babe! Babe, I can explain. You weren't supposed to be home.

Max: People say I deserve better than you.

Robbie: Who? That blonde girl? She doesn't know what she's talkin' about.

Max: She went to Wharton and Switzerland.

Scene: In the restaurant.
-------------------------

Earl: Yo, yo. Look at that. That girl is workin' harder than Stephen Hawking tryin' to put in a pair of cufflinks.

Max: Here, let me help you with that.

Caroline Channing: I don't need any help.

Max: Everyone needs help sometimes.

Customer 6: This isn't what I ordered.

Max: This is Caroline. She may have gotten your order wrong, but she does get some things right. Thank you.

Caroline Channing: No, thank you. What'd you see in that guy, anyway?

Max: He had these muscle thingies.

Caroline Channing: Oh,those things?

Max: Yeah. I don't know what those are called, but they make smart girls stupid.

Oleg: Max! I thought your tight ass wasn't coming in tonight, and my heart broke in half.

Max: You know what, Oleg? I needed that.

Scene: Outside of the restaurant.
---------------------------------

Max: So I... I need a roommate, if you wanna crash.

Caroline Channing: Not gonna lie, the subway's cleaner than your couch.

Max: I just felt myself starting to like you.

Caroline Channing: Really? Because I really feel like we could...

Max: I knew that wouldn't last. Come on. Tomorrow we can go into the city and get the rest of your stuff.

Caroline Channing: Everything's locked up.

Max: What, you have nothing that you care about that we can get?

Caroline Channing: Well, there is one thing.

Scene: In the yard of Max’s apartment.
--------------------------------------

Max: The weirdest thing is that nobody stopped us.

Caroline Channing: I'm gonna save a fortune, keeping him here instead of in the stables.

Max: When did you put this whole horse-in-my-yard thing together?

Caroline Channing: I can't help it. I see an opportunity, and I make it happen, like with your cupcakes.

Max: Like what with my cupcakes?

Caroline Channing: Ready? To open a bake shop, all we need is 250 grand start-up money, for the real estate, and the basic equipment...

Max: Yeah. Oh. 250 grand, that's all? 

Caroline Channing: Yeah.

Max: Did freakin' Chestnut here kick you in the head while I was in Starbucks?

Caroline Channing: Hear me out. If we both worked two jobs and made $2,000 a week, we could open a cupcake business in a little over a year. In the past two days, we've made $387, and that's a good start. We can make extra money at other jobs, like publicists, advertising executives...

Max: janitors, drug mules.

Caroline Channing: We really need to work on your self-esteem. So... You, cupcakes, me, business background, us, success. What do you think?

Max: I think you have a horse.

Caroline Channing: I think we have a horse.

Max: Don't get attached.
